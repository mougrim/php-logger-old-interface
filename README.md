# php-logger-old-interface

This project created for backward compatibility [mougrim/php-logger](https://github.com/mougrim/php-logger) second version with first. You may experience problems with catching exceptions without namespaces. I strongly recommend use `\Mougrim\Logger\LoggerException` instead `\LoggerException`.

It can also be used if you want use logger classes without namespaces.
